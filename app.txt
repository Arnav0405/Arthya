1. Income-Aware Financial Planning
Unlike generic budgeting apps, Arthya is built specifically for variable-income earners.
Traditional tools don't account for income volatility, leading to irrelevant advice.
2. Behavioral AI Adaptation
Arthya uses reinforcement learning to adapt coaching over time, becoming more effective
as it learns user preferences and decision patterns.
3. Localized Affordability
Freemium model ensures accessibility for low-income users. Premium pricing is affordable
(₹399/month) compared to financial advisors (₹500–₹2000 per session).
4. Emerging Market Focus
While global fintech focuses on high-income earners, Arthya targets the 150M+ gig workers
in India alone—an underserved market.
5. Conversational AI Interface
Natural language interaction reduces friction compared to traditional financial tool
interfaces that require financial literacy.
